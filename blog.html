								<h1>Basic Jet Structure</h1>
								<b style="font-size: 20px;color : #a3a3a3;font-family: audiowide-regular-webfont;">Jet Head:</b>
								<p>Due to impact with the stationary ambient gas, 
									a supersonic jet that is propagating into it will develop a double shock pattern at its head (also known as the working surface). 
									While the impacted ambient material is accelerated by a forward bow shaped shock, the beam outflow is decelerated in a jet shock 
									or Mach disk. By balancing the momentum flux produced by the ambient medium at the bow shock with the momentum flux produced by the 
									jet material at the jet head, the velocity of advance of the bow shock may be calculated for highly supersonic flows: $$v_{bs} = v_{j}[1+(\eta\alpha)^{-\frac{1}{2}}]^{-1}$$ where \(v_{j}\) is the jet velocity, 
									\(v_{bs}\) is the velocity of the bow shock, \(\eta = \eta_{j}/\eta_{a}\) is the ratio of the jet number density to the ambient number density and \(\alpha= (R_{j}/R_{h})^{2}\), where \(R_{j}\) is the raduis of the jet beam and 
									\(R_{h}\) is the radius of the jet head. <br>
									AGN are believed to have low density (\(\eta \ll 1 \)) and \(v_{bs} \ll v_{j}\) and jet material is deaccelerated aroung jet forming a cacoon of shock-heated waste material. 
									The shock-heated waste material forms a cocoon around the jet as a result of the high-pressure, shocked gas driving a flow backward around it.

								<h1>Basics Equations in Magnetohydrodynamics</h1>
								<p>The ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations are the conservation equations that can describe the 
									dynamical evolution of a magnetized nonrelativistic flow in the absence of dissipation effects:
									$$\frac{d\rho}{dt} = -\rho\nabla.\vec{v} $$
									$$\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = \frac{\nabla p}{\rho}+\frac{1}{4\pi\rho}(\nabla \times B)\times B$$
									$$\frac{du}{dt}=-\frac{p}{\rho}(\nabla.\vec{v})-L$$
									$$\frac{dB}{dt} = -B(\nabla.\vec{v})+(B.\nabla)\vec{v}$$
									where \(\rho\) is the density; \(B\) is the magnetic field;\(u\) is the specififc internal energy, 
									\(L\) is the radiative cooling effect, \(p\) is the gas pressure and \(\vec{v}\) is the flow velocity.
									<br>The jet velocity, the Mach number, and the ratio of the jet to ambient density are the minimum three variables 
									that must be taken into account by models that account for the jet's overall dynamics. In some cases, it is possible 
									to assume that the bulk kinetic energy density in the jet dominates on the magnetic energy, and in those cases, the general 
									behavior of the jet propagation can be captured by a pure hydrodynamic model. The magnetic field intensity is another important 
									parameter for jet modeling.

								<h1>Astrophysical Jets Theories</h1>
								<p> 
									Two conflicting elements, the speed along the axis and the speed at which waves propagate through the jet, determine the expansionÂ of a jet as well as many other aspects.
									This proportion of speeds is therefore essential to all jet models. An analysis of the MHD flow equations' linear perturbations is done to estimate how quickly signals might spread.
									The formula for sound waves of speed is obtained as $$c_{s} = \sqrt{\frac{dp}{d\rho}}$$
									If we consider adiabatic flow of fluid, i.e, all sources and sink are ingnored, then the sound speed is 
									$$c_{j} = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma p}{\rho}}$$ where in adiabatic law \(p = \rho^{\gamma}\).
								</p>
								<p>
									<b style="font-size: 20px;color : #a3a3a3;font-family: audiowide-regular-webfont;">Alfven Speed:</b>
									Non-dispersive waves propagate along field lines at the Alfven speed, \(v_{A}\), or at a speed, \(v_{A} cos{\phi}\), when they are at an angle to the field direction.
									 Although the fluid is moved against both the wave direction and the field direction, there is no corresponding compression. Then, $$v_{A}=\frac{B}{\sqrt{4\pi\rho}}$$
								</p>
								<p>
									<b style="font-size: 20px;color : #a3a3a3;font-family: audiowide-regular-webfont;">Mach Number:</b>
									Rotational, gravitational, or solar energy are the energy sources for various jet classes. Before becoming the bulk flow of the jets, this energy is transformed into particle, thermal, or magnetic energy.
									If a uniform jet flow is considered, the ratio of bulk kinetic flow energy \(E_{k}\), to thermal energy \(E_{T}\), is proportional to Mach number, \(M\), squared. 
									Then $$M^{2} = \frac{v_{j}^{2}}{c_{s}^{2}} = \frac{2}{\gamma(\gamma -1)} \frac{E_{K}}{E_{T}}$$
							
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b style="font-size: 20px;color : #a3a3a3;font-family: audiowide-regular-webfont;">Steady Jets:</b>
								<p>
									According to Euler's equation, \(\partial v/\partial t = 0\), then, energy conservation per unit mass can be obtained as, 
									$$(\nabla \Phi)^{2} + \frac{2\gamma}{\gamma -1}\frac{p}{\rho}+ 2(\nabla \Phi_{G})^{2} = U^{2}$$ where \(\nabla \Phi\) is the jet velocity in terms of velocity potential, \(U\) is the Bernoulli's constant and 
									\(\Phi_{G}\) is the gravitational potential.
