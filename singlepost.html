							Galactic objects called microquasars have jet production that results 
							from accretion upon a small relativistic particle (neutron star or black hole).
							In other words, all microquasars are found in binary systems that are sufficiently 
							close for the effective flow of matter from the star companion to take place. 
							In such systems, the rate of matter influx is greater than the central object can absorb.
							As a result, some accreting matter—in particular, matter with an excessive amount of angular 
							momentum—is jetted out of the system. <br>Microquasar observations demonstrate the connection between 
							jets and thick accretion discs. In other words, thin disc systems are not known to use jets. Uncertainty
							 exists regarding the cause of this: either a thin disc does not collide the outflow sufficiently, or the 
							 magnetic field produced by the thin disc is insufficient.

							 Some sources exhibit the superluminal motion effect due to the relativistic velocity of the bulk motion of 
							 the matter in the jets, with the apparent angular velocity being several orders of magnitude greater than that seen in jets from active galactic nuclei (due to a relative proximity of these objects).
						</p>

							<b style="font-size: 20px;color : #a3a3a3;font-family: audiowide-regular-webfont;">Radio Pulsars:</b>
							It became evident that the extraordinarily regular pulsations of radio emission recorded were connected to 
							neutron star rotation. The radio pulsars are propelled by the neutron star's rotational energy. The method 
							of energy release is connected to their extremely powerful magnetic field, which has a \(B_{0}=10^{12} G\). In fact, 
							energy losses calculated with the straightforward magnetdipole formula, $$W_{tot}=-J_{r}\Omega\dot{\Omega}$$ where \(J_{r}\equiv MR^{2}\) 
							is the moment of inertia of the neutron star an\ \(\omega = \frac{2\pi}{P}\) is the angular velocity of the neutron star rotation.
							Longitudinal electric currents that loop around the surface of the central engine and circulate in the magnetosphere can result in energy losses.
							As a result, the principal energy release in this instance is also connected to the flux of electromagnetic energy.

						</p>

							<b style="font-size: 20px;color : #a3a3a3;font-family: audiowide-regular-webfont;">YSO:</b>
							At the start of the 1950s, astronomers inadvertently made the discovery of young stars' jets when
							they came upon a new class of extended diffuse objects that typically existed in pairs and were 
							connected by thin jets to young, fast rotating stars. The similarity of the observed patterns suggests 
							that the physical mechanism underlying jet production from young stars and active galactic nuclei may share
							some similarities. The nonrelativistic nature of gas outflow from young stars is one of the major peculiarities here.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b style="font-size: 20px;color : #a3a3a3;font-family: audiowide-regular-webfont;">Active Galactic Nuclei:</b>
							For an active galacti nuclei, the center has a supermassive black hole which accretes the surrounding matter. 
							This is the possibility for high efficiency energy release and compactness of the central engine. The energy is 
							obtained as $$E_{tot} = \frac{J_{r}\Omega_{H}^{2}}{2}$$ where \(J_{r}\) is the moment of inertia,\(\Omega_{H}\) is the angular velocity. 
							<br> The matter in the jet keeps traveling at relativistic speeds up to far distances from the nucleus before stopping noticeably as a 
							result of contact with the surrounding intergalactic medium. The great degree of collimation that jets exhibit within a cone with an opening 
							angle of only a few degrees is another remarkable characteristic of jets.<br> There are several mechanism that has been proposed that talks about the mechanism of energy transfer to a jet.
							<br>
							<br>
							(i) <b>Gas-dynamic acceleration</b> <br>
							The presence of an ambient medium with high pressure that drops with distance from the center may be related to the acceleration and collimation of a jet. 
							A material like this might function as an external wall collimating the outflow. It is theoretically possible to infer the pressure of the external hot medium from X-ray data.<br>
							<br>
							(ii) <b>Acceleration by Radiation</b> <br>
							The radiation-driven method of jet matter acceleration by radiation pressure was postulated because the photon density can be very high close to the central source. 
							According to this hypothesis, the disc's interior can act as a nozzle to direct matter outflows that have been accelerated by radiation pressure. This technique, meanwhile, also encounters some challenges. 
							For instance, there is no relationship between jet power and source luminosity; many sources with extremely strong jets are low-luminous sources.
							<br>
							<br>
							(iii) <b>Magnetohydrodynamic mechanism</b> <br>
							The regular magnetic field produced in the rotating core engine (the disc and the black hole) connects the engine to infinity. 
							Magnetic field lines are where the plasma outflow occurs, and they are also where electromagnetic energy flux is directed. 
							The toroidal magnetic field produced by the jet's longitudinal electric current creates a magnetic field pressure that has the potential to collide with the jet.<br>
							However, it should be emphasized that the entire current flowing from the central engine in a true astrophysical system should cease, therefore the Ampere force at the current 
							closure zone will instead decollate the flow (the antiparallel currents repulse). The jet must therefore collide with an outside medium (such a subrelativistic wind discharge from the accretion disc).
							Additionally, it turns out to be somewhat challenging to determine if a black hole submerged in an external magnetic field may be thought of as a unipolar inductor. After the paper by Blandford and Znajek, 
							which will be detailed later, it took almost 30 years of research.
