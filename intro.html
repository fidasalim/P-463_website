					<h1>Introduction</h1>
					<p>
						<i>"A curious straight ray... apparently connected with the nucleus by a thin line of matter" </i>- the discoverer of 
						astrophysical het Heber Curtis observed it in the giant elliptical galaxy M87.
						Astrophysical jets are actual physical channels that allow matter from stars, galaxies, and extragalactic objects to 
						flow from them to the outer medium. These jets have tiny opening angles, conical shapes, or cylindrical or 
						semi-cylindrical protrusions.These jets are the largest single object in the universe, their size being 100 times
						greater than the size of our galaxy. <br>
						Astrophysical jets are frequently linked to outflows that result from accretion processes in star-forming areas, compact 
						binary systems with nearby objects, active galactic nuclei (AGNs), galaxy clusters, and white dwarf, neutron star,
						and black hole systems. Additionally, they can be seen in some pulsars and &gamma; -ray bursts connected to stellar collapse
						when the jet is directed at the Earth.  The ‘material’ of these astrophysical jets is
						much more than a simple compressible fluid or gas. The gas may consist of a mixture of
						ions, electrons, molecules and dust particles, or can be dominated by a magnetic field and
						relativistic particles.

					<h2>"They Are Morphologically Similar"</h2>
					<p>
						The majority of these outflows, despite having varied physical scales and powers, are morphologically 
						quite similar, which suggests a shared physical genesis, as is frequently underlined in the literature.
						The jet phenomenon is seen on scales that cover more than seven orders of magnitude, as they are observed as 
						AGN jets which have a typical size greater than 10<sup>6</sup>pc 
						then there are YSO jets of size less than 1pc.<br>
						Despite this, all jet classes have similar characteristics.
						They typically exhibit the following characteristics: <br>
							(i) are highly collimated and typically two-sided;<br>
							(ii) originate in compact objects;<br>
							(iii) display a chain of more or less regularly spaced emission knots that occasionally travel 
								away from the central source at high speeds;<br>
							(iv) frequently end in emission lobes (in the case of the YSOs, with line emission).
								In the case of the AGN jets, synchrotron continuous emission), which are thought to be the "working surfaces"
								the jets shock the surrounding medium; <br>
							(v) are connected to magnetic fields whose
								polarisation measurements are used to infer projected directions<br>
							(vi) they display indications of matter accretion.

					<h2>The jets are our beacons.</h2>
					<p>It has been possible to identify entire classes of far-off objects in the cosmos thanks to their jet activity; for those whose members have jets that happen to point in our direction, relativistic beaming increases their luminosity. 
						Few or none of the items would be powerful enough to be detected without the jets.<br>
						Through their jets, star embryos are found and precisely located even within our own galaxy. Protostar jets, which are the condensing gas cores that will someday give rise to stars, 
						pierce through the dense core obscuration and continue through the embedded massive molecular clouds. Since stars are born deep inside dense cores, the protostar is optically obscured, and their jets would likewise be hidden. After emerging from the core, 
						molecules are heated and release radiation at wavelengths longer than in the visible by impact with a less obstructive molecular cloud. A jet can be seen because the infrared, millimetre, and radio emission is less affected by nearby dust particles.</p>
